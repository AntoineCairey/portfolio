# Antoine Cairey's portfolio

Here is my portfolio, a frontend-only responsive website made with React.

It uses Vite as the build tool, and React Router for routing.  
The website's texts and translations are loaded from a YAML file.  
I deployed it on an AWS EC2 instance using Caddy web server on a Docker container.
